                            <br/>Members of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) in a drive detained 10 people and recovered 108,000 yaba pills from their possessions at Kolatoli area in Cox's Bazar on Wednesday afternoon, reports UNB.
                                Aslam Sarkar, 40, an alleged narcotics ring leader in Rajshahi region, was among the detained persons.
                                Being tipped-off, a team of the elite force conducted a drive around 3:00pm and detained 10 people when they went there for shooting of a music video under Sarker Production House.
                                They recovered the contraband tablets from their car, said major Ruhul Amin, company commander of Cox's Bazar camp of RAB-7.

                            <br/>Jatiya Party chairman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina's special emissary Hussain Muhammad Ershad on Wednesday condemned the killing of people in the name of gunfights in the anti-drug drive of law enforcement.
                                “We don’t know the identities of those who are being killed in the name of drive against drug dealers. Key drug dealers are in parliament itself. Execute them through necessary legal process,” said Ershad while addressing a pre-iftar discussion at the Institution of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh in the capital.
                                Jatiya Party's central committee arranged the programme.
                                The former military dictator said the government cannot kill people extra judicially. “Extrajudicial killings will be accepted neither at home nor abroad. Every person has the right to get justice,” he said.
                                He also urged the government to enact a law with a provision of death sentence for drug peddling.

                            <br/>Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday said some 100,000 displaced Rohingya people, now living in Bangladesh, will be shifted to Bhasanchar Island in Noakhali soon for giving them shelter there until their repatriation.
                                The Prime minister said this when UN Under Secretary General and Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Natalia Kanem met her at her office.
                                PM’s press secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters after the meeting.
                                Sheikh Hasina said some 100,000 Rohingyas will be shifted to Bhashanchar soon as 6,000 people are working there to arrange accommodations for them in the island.
                                She said Bangladesh is a disaster-prone country and the upcoming monsoon may cause untold sufferings to the Rohingyas.
                                “We have taken measures for their temporary shelter in Bhashanchar. They will stay there until their repatriation,” she said.
                                Hasina said Bangladesh has given shelter to the Rohingya people who fled persecutions in Myanmar’s Rakhine state on humanitarian grounds.
