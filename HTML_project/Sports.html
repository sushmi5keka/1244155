                            <br/>All-rounder Mosaddek Hossain has been recalled to the Bangladesh squad for next month’s Twenty20 international series against Afghanistan in Dehradun, India.
                            Opener Imrul Kayes and fast bowler Taskin Ahmed, however, have been left out as the BCB announced the team on Sunday.
                            Taskin's omission was predictable, because he is yet to return to full fitness. While the selectors had hinted that they would leave a batsman home to get him prepared for the West Indies tour and Imrul happened to be the one.
                            The inclusion of Mosaddek was still a surprise.
                            The Tigers will play three T20 matches against Afghanistan on 3, 5 and 7 June.
                            The team: Shakib Al Hasan (captain), Mahmudullah, Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Liton Das, Mushfiqur Rahim, Sabbir Rahman, Mosaddek Hossain, Ariful Huq, Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Nazmul Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Abu Hider, Rubel Hossain and Abu Jayed Chowdhury.

                            <br/>Defending champions Mumbai Indians crashed out of the Indian Premier League on Sunday after losing to the Delhi Daredevils by 11 runs, while the Rajasthan Royals became the fourth team to enter the play-offs.
                            The Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai -- winners in 2013, 2015 and 2017 -- suffered their eighth loss in 14 season matches of the cash-rich Twenty20 tournament.
                            In the final league match late Sunday, the Chennai Super Kings beat Kings XI Punjab by five wickets to clear the way for the Royals, who had registered their seventh win on the weekend.
                            South African fast bowler Lungi Ngidi starred for second-placed Chennai, taking four wickets for just 10 runs to help dismiss Punjab for 153.

                    <br/>Tottenham striker Harry Kane will be England’s captain at the World Cup in Russia, the Football Association said on Tuesday.
                    Manager Gareth Southgate named the 24-year-old as his skipper for the tournament during a meeting with the squad on Monday, the FA said in a statement on Tuesday.
                    “Harry has some outstanding personal qualities,” Southgate said. “He is a meticulous professional and one of the most important things for a captain is that they set the standard every day.
                    “He has belief and high standards and it is a great message for the team to have a captain who has shown that it is possible to be one of the best in the world over a consistent period of time and that has been his drive.
                    “My feeling is that over the last 18 months in the camps that he’s been with us he has shown that he has got the desire to take that into a team environment and he recognises the importance of bringing others with him.”
