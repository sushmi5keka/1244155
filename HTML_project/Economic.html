                            <br/>Tea prices in Bangladesh climbed at the weekly auction due to strong demand and tight supplies.
                                Bangladeshi tea fetched an average of Tk 216.14 ($2.6) per kg at the new auction centre in Srimangal on Monday, compared with Tk 213.09 at the previous sale in the port city of
                                Chittagong.
                                There was robust demand from buyers in the new auction centre in the country’s northeastern region where most of the tea gardens are located, an official at National Brokers said.
                                Almost all the tea offered at the auction centre was sold, he added.
                                Only 1.85 per cent of the 538,843 kg offered in Srimangal was unsold. At the previous auction in Chittagong, around 1.18 kg was offered, of which 7.2 per cent went unsold.
                                Bangladesh’s tea production dropped to nearly 79 million kg in 2017 from a record 85 million kg the previous year, which officials attributed to excessive rainfall.
                                The South Asian country was the world’s fifth-largest tea exporter in the 1990s but is now a net importer because of a surge in domestic consumption in line with economic growth.

                            <br/>Asian markets were mixed Thursday with traders concerned about the China-US trade deal and Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong Un, while automakers were hit by news Washington was considering huge tariffs on vehicle imports.
                            Investors went into selling mode despite minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting that showed the central bank was less hawkish on interest rates than previously thought.
                            The selling is a far cry from the start of the week when equities rallied on news that top officials from China and the United States had agreed to pull back from imposing levies on billions of dollars of goods, averting a potentially damaging trade war.
                            But since Monday's gains, Trump has voiced his displeasure at that agreement and also raised the possibility that a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim on June 12 could be delayed or called off.
                            A key aide to Kim on Thursday hit out at comments from Vice President Mike Pence and warned the talks could be cancelled.
